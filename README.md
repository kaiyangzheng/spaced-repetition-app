# Retasker - A simple automated and social spaced repetition application

# Overall Goals

- Allow users to better study material with spaced repetition
- Create a social study space where users can interact and study with others
- Use analytical methods to aid the user in studying

As Ebbinghaus put it:

> ***“With any considerable number of repetitions, a suitable distribution of them over a space of time is decidedly more advantageous than the massing of them at a single time.”***
